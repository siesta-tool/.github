Analyzing sequential event data tremendously benefits organizations by enabling them to identify potential process optimizations and extract useful insights. However, there is a lack of systems that can both efficiently query complex ad-hoc patterns and perform advanced sequential pattern mining-like tasks. To address this, we have proposed SIESTA, which stands for Scalable Infrastructure for sEquential paTtern Analysis, and is a scalable tool designed to support both pattern detection and pattern mining in large event log datasets that are continuously updated. This repository demonstrates how the entire SIESTA infrastructure can be deployed using Docker containers.
