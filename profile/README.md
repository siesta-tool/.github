SIESTA (Scalable InfrastructurE for Sequential paTtern Analysis) is an application-agnostic, open-source tool designed to build incremental indices from continuously streaming event data. These indices enable efficient analysis of the data, supporting tasks such as detecting complex patterns, predicting future events, and uncovering constraints that describe both the sequence order and temporal aspects of the events. By providing actionable insights, SIESTA empowers users to better understand and interpret their sequential data.
